## ‚öôÔ∏è DevOps & Infrastructure

This project is set up for **continuous deployment** to AWS using a GitHub Actions workflow:

- **Automatic Deployment:**  
  Every push to the `main` branch triggers the workflow defined in `.github/workflows/front-end-cicd.yml`.
- **S3 Sync:**  
  The workflow uses the `jakejarvis/s3-sync-action` to upload the built site to an S3 bucket.
- **CloudFront Invalidation:**  
  After deployment, the workflow invalidates the CloudFront cache to ensure users always see the latest version.
- **AWS Credentials:**  
  All AWS credentials and configuration are securely managed using GitHub Secrets.

**Workflow Highlights:**

## üèÜ Why This Project Stands Out

- **End-to-End Solution:** From code to cloud, this project demonstrates the full lifecycle of a modern web application.
- **DevOps Integration:** Automated, zero-downtime deployments with cache invalidation.
- **Cloud Native:** Built for scalability and performance using AWS infrastructure.
- **Professional Polish:** Clean design, smooth UX, and production-ready code.
